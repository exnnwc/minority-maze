Minority Maze
==========

~~ To Do ~~
~~ Realized the reason why hostiles aren't being removed is because I'm not removing them from the map. ~~
~~ Randomly move hostiles? ~~
~~ Don't have hostiles move when player is around. ~~
~~ Place a large GAME OVER text in red when player loses. ~~
~~ If friendlies have line of sight to hostiles, they go right for them. ~~

Possibilities
If hostile has just been spawned, they're invincible and can kill friendlies.
